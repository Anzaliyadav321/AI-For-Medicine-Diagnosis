In this lesson, we'll look at one of the most useful tools
to evaluate medical models, the ROC curve. We'll see how the ROC curve allows
us to visually plot the sensitivity of a model against the specificity of the
model at different decision thresholds. A chest x-ray classification model outputs
a probability of disease given an x-ray. This output can be transformed into
a diagnosis using a threshold or operating point. When the probability is above a threshold, then we interpret this as positive or
saying the patient has the disease. When the probability is
below the threshold, we interpret this as negative or saying
the patient does not have the disease. For example, if our score is 0.7 and
our threshold is 0.5, then we would classify
this example as positive. But if our score was 0.2 and
our threshold was 0.5, we would classify this
example as negative. Our choice of threshold affects
the metrics we have looked at thus far. For example, if we had a threshold t of 0 then we would classify
everything as positive. And so our sensitivity would be one
while our specificity would be zero. Similarly, if we had chosen a threshold
of one we would classify everything as negative, so our specificity would be
one while our sensitivity would be zero. Let's dive further into how our
choice of threshold also called the operating point
affects these quantities.
