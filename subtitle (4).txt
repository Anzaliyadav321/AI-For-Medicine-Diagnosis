Now that you've learned
about classification and segmentation models
for medical imaging, and you've built your chest x-ray
classification model earlier, you might wonder why
the systems aren't in use today at hospitals
or clinics around us. In this lesson, you will learn about some of the challenges and opportunities to
make these systems part of routine medical practice. One of the main challenges with applying AI algorithms
in the clinic is achieving reliable
generalization. Generalization can be hard
due to a variety of reasons. Let's look at an example. Let's say we developed our
chest x-ray model on US data, and we wanted to apply
it to a hospital in a different
country, say India. In India, the patient
population might have x-rays that looked different than what the model
has been trained on. As a very concrete example, tuberculosis is quite
prevalent in India, but unlikely to be
as prevalent in the hospitals where we've
trained our model in the US. Before applying the
model in India, we'd want to test the model on its ability to detect
TB, or tuberculosis. Let's look at another example. This time with our model for
brain tumor segmentation. We've been able to measure
the model performance on data collected from a few
countries over a few years, but MRI technology is not standard across the
globe and across time. The latest scanners have much higher resolution
than older scanners. Before we apply the segmentation
model in a new hospital, we'd want to make sure
that the model is able to generalize to the resolution of the scanner at the hospital.
