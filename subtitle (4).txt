Let's say we have a test
set of 15 chest x-rays, which we ran through
our model to get an output probability or
a score for each of them. We can plot these
15 outputs scores on a number line
between zero and one. Now some of these
x-rays will have a ground truth of disease
and some will be normal. So let's color them accordingly. Here disease is red
and normal is blue. We can pick a threshold small t, that sets everything on the
right of the threshold as we classify positive and everything on the left of the threshold, we classify as negative. Now notice we can compute the sensitivity and
specificity of the model. Here, the denominator for sensitivity is the total
number of disease examples, which we can count as
the total number of red, which is going to be seven. The numerator is how many
of those are positive, or in other words, on the right side
of the threshold. This is all of them
except one, which is six. So our sensitivity is
six over seven, or 0.85. Similarly, the denominator for specificity is the total
number of normal examples, which is the total number of blue circles here,
which is eight. The numerator is how many
of those are negative, or in other words, on the left side
of the threshold. This is all except
two, so this is six. So our specificity is
six over eight or 0.75. Let's say we now change the threshold such
that it was higher. We now expect, we classify fewer examples as positive and
more examples as negative. We can now recompute the
sensitivity and specificity. Note that the sensitivity
has gone down, our numerator has fallen, and the specificity has gone up, our numerator has increased because we are now
correctly classifying more normal patients
and incorrectly classifying more
disease patients. We can take this to the extreme and set the threshold
to be at one. In this case, sensitivity
is going to be zero since no examples
are classified positive, and specificity is
going to be one, since all the examples are
classified as negative.
