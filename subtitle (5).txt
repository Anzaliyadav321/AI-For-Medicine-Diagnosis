In this lesson, we'll look at another very
important aspect of evaluating medical models and that is reporting
the variability in our estimate. We will look at how confidence intervals
can be used to show this variability. Let's say there were 50,000
patients in a hospital and we wanted to find out the accuracy
of our chest x-ray model on everyone who gets the chest x-ray in the hospital. If we were able to run the model and
get the ground truth for all patients, we would be able to get the performance
of the model on the whole population. For example,
say we're looking at accuracy, but this could be any other metric. We find that the accuracy of the model
around all 50,000 patients is 0.78. This is called the population accuracy,
here with small p. In reality, we don't want to
test the model on the whole population because it's
simply infeasible to do so. Therefore, the population
accuracy p is unknown. The question is, can we get a sense
of how well the model will perform on this population by using
a small sample of patients? Let's say we sample a hundred
patients from the hospital. Now we find that the model gets
an accuracy of 0.8 on the set. Can we say anything about the range in
which the population accuracy p will lie?
