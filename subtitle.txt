This week, you'll
learn about building models that are not only able to classify whether
a medical image contains a disease or not, but also outline which parts of the image contained
the disease. This is the task of
image segmentation. Image segmentation
plays a vital role in numerous medical
imaging applications, such as the quantification
of the size of tissues, the localization of diseases,
and treatment planning. We'll revisit some of the same ideas that
you've learned in the last two weeks and see how they extend to
image segmentation. In this lesson, we'll learn about MRI data and tumor segmentation. Learning about MRI data will be important in guiding how we think about representing data for building a segmentation model
in the next lesson.
