00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.090
Sensitivity tells us given we
know a patient has a disease,

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.750
what is the probability that
the model predicts positive?

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.830
In the clinic, the doctor using an AI model
may be interested in a different question.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.950
And that is given the model
predicts positive on a patient,

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.900
what is the probability that
they actually have the disease?

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.115
This is called the positive
predictive value or PPV of the model.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.080
Similarly, while specificity asks,

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.260
what is the probability the model predicts
negative, given a patient is normal?

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.700
The doctor may be interested in knowing
the probability that a patient is normal,

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450
given the model prediction is negative.

11
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.680
This is called the negative
predictive value or NPV of a model.

12
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.503
Let's compute the PPV and
NPV on an example.

13
00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:59.301
Once again, we have ten examples on
which a model has made its predictions.

14
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:01.809
First, let's compute PPV.

15
00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.230
PPV can be computed as the fraction of
positive examples that are also disease.

16
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.811
So in the denominator,

17
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:15.164
we'll have the number of positive
which is one two, three four.

18
00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:19.990
And in the numerator,
the number that is positive and disease.

19
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.730
So that's one, that's two and
we just have two, so

20
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.130
2 over 4, or 0.5.

21
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.355
Let's now look at NPV.

22
00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:36.292
NPV can be computed as the fraction of
negative examples that are also normals.

23
00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:41.235
So in the denominator, we're looking
at everywhere the model prediction is negative,

24
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:44.980
it's one, two,
three, four, five, six.

25
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.140
And in the numerator all
the places where it's negative and

26
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.920
the ground truth is normal.

27
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.190
So that's one, that's two,
that's three, that's four,

28
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.390
and that's five, so
this 5 over 6, or 0.83.

29
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.700
Now that we've seen PPV and NPV,
in addition to sensitivity and

30
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.070
specificity, let's look at how
they relate to each other.
