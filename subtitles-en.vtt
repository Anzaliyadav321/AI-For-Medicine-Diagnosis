00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's understand the accuracy
metric a little more.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.675
We'll see how we can use
the accuracy to derive

3
00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.000
other useful evaluation metrics

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.390
such as sensitivity
and specificity.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.555
We'll start by
interpreting accuracy

6
00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.540
as a probability
of being correct.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.300
We can break down this
probability of being

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.045
correct as the sum of
two probabilities.

9
00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:26.930
The probability that the model is

10
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.880
correct and a patient has

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.430
the disease plus the
probability that

12
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.460
the model is correct and
the patient is normal.

13
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.275
The law of conditional
probability

14
00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:41.855
allows us to further
expand this out.

15
00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:43.940
As a reminder, the law of

16
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.045
conditional probability
says that the probability

17
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.490
of A and B is the probability of

18
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.355
A given B times the
probability of B.

19
00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:56.660
We can apply this to the
first term to expand it out

20
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.100
here and to the second term
to expand it out here.

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.420
What this allows us to do is

22
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.410
interpret these terms over here.

23
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.150
The probability of being
correct given the patient

24
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.275
has the disease means that
we predicted positive.

25
00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.290
So we can replace this by
the probability that we

26
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.889
predict positive given
a patient has disease.

27
00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:28.820
Similarly, the probability
of being correct when

28
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.130
the patient is normal would

29
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.559
mean that we predicted negative,

30
00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:36.110
so we can replace this
by the probability of

31
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.800
predicting negative given
a patient is normal.
